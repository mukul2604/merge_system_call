Xmergesort Module:
Merge two given input files which are already sorted or partially sorted.

Design Decisions:
1. Each line of file can contain max 200 words in this code, for simplicity.
   i.e. support of max 200 words per line. This can be configured easily.
2. Number of pages required = 4 for this implementation. one each for two input files and
   two for the output file. In case of line crossing page boundary, skip the last line and process
   the skipped line in next iteration.
3. This sorting is not lexicographical sorting; it is ascii value based sorting.
4. Don't overwrite the output file if already exists, error out, user has to give different output filename.
5. for >= 10 file supports, uncomment the macro in xmergesort.c file
6. Implementation of -u, -a, -i, -t, -d options.
7. -h option is for help.
8. output file permission won't be greater than the lowest permission of an input file.
